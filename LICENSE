The original Tiny Elvis files were distributed with the following licence:

    This program (Tiny Elvis for Windows) is hereby contributed "as
    is" to the public domain.  The program, including its companion
    waveform audio and documentation files, is distributed as
    freeware.  As such, it is not intended for sale, resale, purchase,
    or for-profit distribution in the shareware or retail marketplace.

    Users are free to install and run the program on any system or
    systems they wish (subject only to the program's hardware
    requirements).  Users are also free to copy and re-distribute
    the original files in any manner of via any channel available to
    them (i.e., network, BBS, electronic information service, etc.).

    Users doing so must distribute only the original files
    (preferably in their original compressed format).  When so
    distributed, it is the distributor's responsibility to ensure
    that the program files have been kept in their original state
    and format, and have not been altered, edited, disassembled, or
    recompiled in any way.

    That said, please do not disassemble the original executable or
    edit any of its embedded resources (well, okay, on second thought
    -- if you're really in DIRE need of a few Elvis icons, go ahead
    and extract a few, just leave everything else alone).
